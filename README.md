# Sorting Algorithms, Computational Algorithms Project

### Project Specification

* Write an application that will be used to benchmark five different sorting algorithms.

* Write a report which introduces each chosen sorting algorithm and discuss the results of the benchmarking process.



### Project Description

I used Java for my benchmarking application and tested each sorting algorithm with various input sizes ranging from 100 to 25000, to get the average run time (out of 10) for each algorithm at each input size.

I chose five different sorting algorithms to discuss and benchmark:

1. Bubble sort (a simple comparison-based sort)
1. Merge sort (an efficient comparison-based sort)
1. Counting sort (a non-comparison sort)
1. Insertion sort (a sorting algorithm of my choosing)
1. Shell sort (a sorting algorithm of my choosing)

The /src folder contains the source code of the application and the pdf file 'sorting-algorithms' contains the project report.
